On the iTunes websites ([Apple Music/Radio](https://music.apple.com), [Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com), [Apps/Games](https://www.apple.com/app-store), etc.), you can get the cover image (e.g. by `Open in new tab` or `Inspect`), however, these images are resized at lower resolutions (removing the resizing suffix (e.g. "/540x540bb.webp") will not work), so this [bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) script converts the resized image link to the original image link (to obtain the cover image in its original quality).

## How to use
Create a new bookmark in your browser, copy the entire content from **script.bookmarklet.js** into the URL field of the bookmark.  
Go to the browser tab of the iTunes image link, click on the previously created bookmark, the image link will be converted automatically.
